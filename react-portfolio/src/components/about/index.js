<h1> About Me </h1>
<p> I'm a full stack developer, a recent graduate of UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp. I've been passionate about video games since I was a little girl.
My first dream job was to work for Square Enix, 
creating characters for the Final Fantasy series!
My passion for art, love of video games, 
and need for creativity is what drove me to pursue a career
as a developer. The sole motivation behind my work is to create;
to one day be able to offer people memorable and treasured experiences,
akin to the ones I was lucky enough to have as a child - through games.</p>
